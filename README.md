# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Purpose
This is a learning project for CWRU's coding bootcamp.  The project is designed to utilize bootstrap, jQuery, and Moment.js along with Javascript and CSS to build a simple daily planner.  The goal is to have the background color change for each time block as time progesses.  Each time block should be selectable and have its own save button.  Once the save button is selected it should save the text in the time block to local storage and reload it if someone refreshes the page.
